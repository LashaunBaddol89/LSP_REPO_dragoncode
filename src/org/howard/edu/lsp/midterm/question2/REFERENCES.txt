Howard University — Large Scale Programming (Fall 2025)
Midterm Question 2 — References

Question Summary:
Question 2 required implementing a class named AreaCalculator with four
overloaded static methods named `area(...)` to compute the areas of
different shapes:
• Circle: area(double radius)
• Rectangle: area(double width, double height)
• Triangle: area(int base, int height)
• Square: area(int side)

Each method throws an IllegalArgumentException if any dimension ≤ 0.
A separate Main.java demonstrates all overloads, exact expected outputs,
and exception handling.

Sources and Development Process:
• Original problem statement taken directly from the Midterm Exam prompt
  (Google Doc provided by the instructor, October 20, 2025).
• Code and logic implemented by the student based on standard geometry
  formulas and Java overloading rules.
• ChatGPT (GPT-5, October 20, 2025) was used to review syntax correctness,
  validate arithmetic expressions, and help verify exception handling
  behavior for negative inputs.
• All output formatting and final code were written and verified manually
  by the student through local testing.

Deliverables produced:
• AreaCalculator.java
• Main.java
• Working output demonstrating all overloaded methods and exception handling.

No external code repositories, textbooks, or web examples were used.
All material derives from the course prompt and the student's own implementation.
