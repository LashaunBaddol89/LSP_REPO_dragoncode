Howard University — Large Scale Programming (Fall 2025)
Midterm Exam — AI Usage Report
Student: [Your Name]
Date: October 20, 2025

========================================
Purpose
========================================
This document summarizes how AI assistance (ChatGPT — GPT-5) was used
throughout the Large-Scale Programming midterm exam. 
Per exam policy, all AI-generated or AI-assisted content is acknowledged here.

========================================
Summary of AI Use
========================================
• Question 1 (Cohesion Analysis):
  I used ChatGPT to help restate Arthur Riel’s cohesion heuristics and
  to structure my explanation of how StudentPortalHelper violates 
  single-responsibility principles. The analysis and refactor outline
  were then rewritten in my own words.

• Question 2 (AreaCalculator Program):
  I asked for guidance on verifying method overloading and exception
  handling. ChatGPT provided an example structure, which I adapted to 
  match the assignment’s output format.

• Question 3 (Car Trim-Level Refactor):
  ChatGPT helped me understand how composition could replace subclassing
  to allow dynamic trim changes. I expanded this explanation and connected
  it to my own understanding of design patterns.

• Question 4 (Smart-Campus Device System):
  ChatGPT helped me outline the full Java structure (Device, interfaces,
  and subclasses), correct syntax issues, debug compile errors in PowerShell,
  and write the rationale about abstraction and interfaces. I verified all
  code locally before committing it.

• Question 5 (AI Reflection):
  I collaborated with ChatGPT to draft the reflection, focusing on how AI
  supported my learning and debugging process. The final paragraph is my
  personal reflection rewritten in my own words.

========================================
Verification
========================================
All code was reviewed, compiled, and tested by me personally before submission.
AI was used only for explanation, structure, and debugging — not for direct
submission of unverified code.

Acknowledgement
========================================
Tool used: ChatGPT (GPT-5, OpenAI)
Sessions: October 19–20, 2025
All relevant excerpts are included below.

========================================
Selected Excerpts
========================================
Example – Debugging Question 4 (Camera.java)
----------------------------------------
User: "how i test all the files you had me make before with the camera.java, DoorLock.java and the rest"
AI: "Use javac -d out (Get-ChildItem -Recurse ...) then java -cp out org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question4.Main"

Example – Essay Guidance for Question 1
----------------------------------------
AI: "Using Riel’s cohesion heuristics… StudentPortalHelper shows low cohesion.
It mixes unrelated concerns: GPA computation, CSV export, email formatting..."
User: "that’s the perfect structure."

Example – Rationale Explanation
----------------------------------------
AI: "Device is defined as an abstract class because it represents the shared
core of all campus devices but should never be instantiated…"
