Question Summary:
Question 4 required designing and implementing a "Smart-Campus Device System"
to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles of inheritance,
abstraction, and interface implementation.

The task specified:
• An abstract base class: Device.java (provided in prompt)
• Two interfaces: Networked and BatteryPowered
• Three concrete classes: DoorLock, Thermostat, Camera
• A provided driver: Main.java (testing heartbeat, connectivity, and polymorphism)
• A short rationale explaining abstraction, interfaces, and multiple inheritance.

Sources and Development Process:
• All specifications and base class structure derived directly from the
  Midterm Exam prompt (Google Doc provided by instructor, October 20, 2025).
• Student authored Networked.java, BatteryPowered.java, DoorLock.java,
  Thermostat.java, and Camera.java following the behavioral contracts.
• ChatGPT (GPT-5, October 20, 2025) was used interactively to:
  – Debug PowerShell compilation commands (`javac -d out ...`)
  – Verify method overrides and ensure matching signatures
  – Explain rationale about abstraction, interface polymorphism, and inheritance
  – Provide expected runtime output for validation
• All code compiled and executed successfully under
  `java -cp out org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question4.Main`.

Deliverables produced:
• Device.java (unmodified, from prompt)
• Networked.java
• BatteryPowered.java
• DoorLock.java
• Thermostat.java
• Camera.java
• Main.java (unmodified, from prompt)
• Question4_Rationale.txt

No external frameworks, libraries, or tutorials were used.
All testing performed locally by the student.
